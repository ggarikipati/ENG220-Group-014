/*
This project was designed to show the data throughout the U.S, and specifically New Mexico, to indicate that there is a major
mental health problem in the country. A dashboard was created to show the data with graphs and charts. The user that examines
the data can change the graphs to see specific states in mind, like New Mexico.
